#
# Set location of various cgtools
#
# These variables can be set here or on the command line.  Paths must not
# have spaces.
#
# The various *_ARMCOMPILER variables, in addition to pointing to
# their respective locations, also serve as "switches" for disabling a build
# using those cgtools. To disable a build using a specific cgtool, either set
# the cgtool's variable to empty or delete/comment-out its definition:
#     TICLANG_ARMCOMPILER ?=
# or
#     #TICLANG_ARMCOMPILER ?= ...
#
# If a cgtool's *_ARMCOMPILER variable is set (non-empty), various sub-makes
# in the installation will attempt to build with that cgtool.  This means
# that if multiple *_ARMCOMPILER cgtool variables are set, the sub-makes
# will build using each non-empty *_ARMCOMPILER cgtool.
